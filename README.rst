Polysh
======

Polysh (formerly called Group Shell or gsh) is a remote shell multiplexer. It
lets you control many remote shells at once in a single shell. Unlike other
commands dispatchers, it is interactive, so shells spawned on the remote hosts
are persistent. It requires only a SSH server on the remote hosts, or some other
way to open a remote shell.

Python >= 3.4 is required.
